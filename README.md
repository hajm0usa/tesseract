# Tesseract

Tesseract is a fork of the Cube 2: Sauerbraten engine. The goal of Tesseract
is to make mapping more fun by using modern dynamic rendering techniques, so
that you can get instant feedback on lighting changes, not just geometry.

##### Tesseract has a bunch of rendering features such as:
* deferred shading
* omnidirectional point lights using cubemap shadowmaps
* perspective projection spotlight shadowmaps
* orthographic projection sunlight using cascaded shadowmaps
* HDR rendering with tonemapping and bloom
* real-time diffuse global illumination for sunlight (radiance hints)
* volumetric lighting
* transparent shadows
* screen-space ambient occlusion
* screen-space reflections and refractions for water and glass (use as many water planes as you want now!)
* screen-space refractive alpha cubes
* deferred MSAA, subpixel morphological anti-aliasing (SMAA 1x, T2x, S2x, and 4x), FXAA, and temporal AA
* runs on both OpenGL Core (3.0+) and legacy (2.0+) contexts


#### ⚠️ Notice:
* This is my weekend project and i cant work on it with a good progress until 2025 June 26!
* I'm only a developr and i cant make models, textures, animations and musics for game. If you can make these things for game, I'm glad to work with you!
